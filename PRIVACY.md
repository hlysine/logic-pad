## 1. What Information We Collect

We collect a very small amount of information, which falls into two categories:

**A. Information You Provide to Us:**

* **Account Information:** To create an account, you can log in using Google or Discord. When you do this, we receive your **name** and **email address**.
    * Your **email address** is kept private. We only use it to make sure your account is unique and for essential account-related communication. We will not send you marketing emails.
    * Your **name** is shown publicly next to your puzzles, collections, and comments. You can change this name anytime in your account settings.

**B. Information We Collect Automatically:**

* **Session Information:** We use a single, first-party cookie on your device. Its only purpose is to keep you logged in so you don't have to sign in every time you visit. It does not track you across other websites.
* **Anonymous Analytics:** We want to understand how our site is performing and how many people are visiting. We use some privacy-focused tools for this:
    * **Cloudflare Web Analytics:** This service gives us basic traffic data (e.g., how many people visited today) without using any cookies or tracking individual users.
    * **Vercel Speed Insights:** This tool helps us measure the performance of our website to make it faster. It does not collect any personal or user-related information.
    * **Error Reporting:** We use **Sentry** to automatically collect error reports from our website. This helps us identify and fix issues quickly. The information collected may include technical details about your device and browser, but it does not include personal information like your name, email address or IP address.



## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following reasons:

* **To Provide the Service:** To let you log in, create puzzles, build collections, and comment.
* **To Manage Your Account:** To prevent duplicate accounts and handle essential account management tasks.
* **To Improve Our Website:** To understand website traffic and performance so we can make Logic Pad better for everyone.



## 3. How We Share Your Information

**We do not sell, rent, or share your private information (like your email address) with any third parties.**

The only information about you that is shared is the information that is public by design on Logic Pad:

* Your public name.
* The puzzles you publish.
* The collections you create and have made public.
* The comments you post.



## 4. Your Control Over Your Content

You have control over the content you create on Logic Pad.

* **Puzzles:** You can freely edit your puzzles at any time. However, **once a puzzle is made public by publishing it, it cannot be deleted.** This is to ensure that collections or comments from other users that refer to your puzzle are not broken.
* **Collections:** You can freely edit and delete your puzzle collections, or make them private at any time.
* **Comments:** You can freely edit and delete your comments at any time.

Please contact us if you wish to delete your account. Note that because puzzles cannot be deleted, they will remain on the site anonymously.



## 5. Data Storage and Security

All of your account and site data (puzzles, comments, etc.) is stored using **Appwrite**, a secure, open-source backend service. Appwrite is compliant with modern privacy regulations like the GDPR, and we rely on their security measures to keep your data safe.



## 6. Children's Privacy

Logic Pad is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.



## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will do our best to notify you. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will always show when the policy was last revised.
